# Wu-Tang Name Generator Project
Come on in and lets get you a Wu-Tang Name!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Within this project it was very easy to understand what I needed to do and what actions to take. Now displaying that information was a whole other story. JavaScript is something that I really needed to work on and from previous projects I saw that there same functionality where the user just needs to hit a button and boom things will start to happen. So now what I needed to do is go into my JS made sure that when the user hits Generate they would get a name and the same name everytime they enter their own name. I made sure that when I used my name during the testing that I would get the same name in which I did.

## Lessons Learned:

Slowly doing these projects they are never done there are always things to do and make it better. Knowing that I got this done is an amazing feeling and as well knowing that it works makes things a bit better more than ever. BUT this does not mean that this is done, later on down the line i am going to make sure that I design the page right
